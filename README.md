# Global Sales Data Pipeline

## Overview
This project automates the sales data ingestion and reporting process for multiple regions — France, Netherlands, and Portugal — using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services.
Each regional user uploads their CSV sales files via a web application, which triggers a fully automated pipeline from upload to visualization in Looker.
